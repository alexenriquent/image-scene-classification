# Image Scene Classification

The aim of this project is to demonstrate an MLOps end-to-end pipeline by automating building and deploying the image scene classification model into production using CI/CD. The entire process from model development to deployment involves the use of Streamlit, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub, and Google Cloud.
